# Spell Checker

# Introduction
This spell checker was created as the Individual Project during studies at the University of Leeds

It detects two types of errors in the Welsh Language:
- Non-Word Errors - Words that are misspelled and not recognised
- Real-Word Errors - Words that are misspelled by the user, but are recognised.

## Using the program
Run the program by simply typing into the terminal:
        `python spellChecker.py`

To use the application, simply write text into the text box, then press `Check Spelling`.
Any misspellings found will be brought up and explained, and the user will be able to either accept the correction or ignore it, by pressing either the `Accept` or `Ignore` buttons respectively.

NOTE - since no spell checker is 100% accurate, it is possible that some suggestions of corrections will be incorrect.
